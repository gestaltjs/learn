# Learn
ðŸ“š A structured learning journey to get familiar with the Javascript, Node, and Web ecosystems.

## How to use it

Continue reading through this `README.md` file. The content in this file will guide you through resources, questions, and exercises to consolidate the different areas of knowledge.

## Themes

### 1. Javascript

Javascript is the language that powers GestaltJS and the apps that developers build with it. It's a language that emerged to make the web dynamic, and that popularized to the point that it can be used in any imaginable platform: [*Anything that can be Written in JavaScript, will Eventually be Written in JavaScript*](https://www.typemock.com/anything-that-can-be-written-in-javascript-will-eventually-be-written-in-javascript/). We don't need to know everything about Javascript to build software with it. However, we need to be familiar with the most basic units of composition and the syntax to write software that's readable, well-architected and testable. If you need to learn further about any Javascript concept or API, you can use the wonderful [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) from Mozilla.
